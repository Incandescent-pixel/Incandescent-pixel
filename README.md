Am I an incandescent pixel? I'd like to think I have the potential to be, we'll see.


I'm not a developer nor am I aspiring. Who knows maybe that will change?!
I spent some time in my youth mastering HTML on various forums. Additionally, experienced a sense of pride when my JSON syntax worked.
I've known about GitHub for some time and am glad to finally bite the bullet and discover how it all works.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how GitHub works through use of GitHub skills courses. I'll aim to complete one course per day.
